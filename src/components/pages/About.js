                In my free time I love to snowboard and overland with my dog and
                friends. I moved to Colorado in December of 2017, from Wichita,
                KS, to continue my careeer in the financial services industry. I
                recently transitioned from Branch Operations to Enterprise
                Application Services as a DevOps Engineer. I love Formula 1 and
                the NFL. My favorite driver is Max Verstappen and my favorite
                NFL team is the Kansas City Chiefs. I look forward to
                overlanding and camping as much as possible in my truck with my pup Kip!
